# CalEvent Sensor Based Android App Project
Android Jetpack Compose application development course - Autumn 2022 - Metropolia University Of Applied Sciences. The idea is to build a mobile application using Kotlin programming language while following the use of the Material Theme UI guidelines as well as course requirements. This is a pairwork project and was done in a three-week period where a meeting is held every other day between the team members to update the tasks, discuss and fix errors.
